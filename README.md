# K_Mean_like_Clustering
This project implements a custom version of the K-Means clustering algorithm in Python using only NumPy and basic Python toolsâ€”no machine learning libraries involved. It includes a unique feature: automatic feature weighting, which helps improve clustering performance by giving more importance to relevant features.
